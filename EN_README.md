# AdminGDPS
Only with adding these files to your Geometry Dash Private Server will you have control over the accounts and moderators of your server.

# Requirements
* Have a Geometry Dash Private Server.
  * The files must be those of [Cvolton](https://github.com/Cvolton/GMDprivateServer).
* GDPS Version +2.1
  * This so that all functions of [tools](./herramientas) are available. (Quests, Gauntlets [COMING SOON])

# Set Up
Hello! Its JeffreyG / JeffreyGMD. Thank you for downloading this GDPS administrator!<br>
 I tried to make it as simple as possible for anyone. Then I will tell you the first thing you must do to make this work.<br><br>

1. Go to the `conx.php` file and change the data to the database of your GDPS, the lenguage and also the secret password. ðŸ¤«<br>
2. After you have the data ready, upload the updated file to the web page. <br>
3. To verify that the data is correct and that the db (database) is connected to the web page, enter to `chkCon.php` file **From the browser.**<br>
4. Delete the file `en.html` **AND** `index.html` **DO NOT** delete `index.php`.
5. Go to `index.php` and enjoy. ðŸ™‚ <br><br>
*It only supports the files of [GDPS Cvolton](https://github.com/Cvolton/GMDprivateServer)*
